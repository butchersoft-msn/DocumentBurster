<p class="ProductList-Offering1Heading">Supplemental Terms for Professional Services – Legacy Agreements</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Customer’s right to use of any consulting and support services Microsoft performs (“Professional Services”) purchased from the Product Terms are governed by (1) customer’s volume licensing agreement, and (2) any master-level Microsoft Services agreement customer may have in place at the time of purchase. In the event of a conflict, the most current Professional Services agreement controls. If Customer’s master agreement for volume licensing is a Microsoft Business Agreement version dated prior to September, 2007 or otherwise does not include terms for Professional Services, and Customer has not signed any other master-level Microsoft Services agreement, the following supplemental terms apply to any Professional Services purchased and used by Customer.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">Use, Ownership, and License Rights</p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Fixes</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">If Microsoft provides Product Fixes, modifications or enhancements, or their derivatives, either released generally (such as Product service packs) or to address a specific issue for Customer (collectively, “Fixes”), such Fixes are licensed under the same terms as the Product to which it applies. If the Fixes are not provided for a specific product, any use terms Microsoft provides with the Fixes will apply</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Pre-Existing Work</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">All rights in any computer code or non-code based written materials developed or otherwise obtained independent of the Professional Services provided to Customer (“Pre-Existing Work”) shall remain the sole property of the party providing it. Each party may use, reproduce and modify the other party’s Pre-Existing Work only as needed to perform obligations related to Professional Services.</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">Except as may be otherwise expressly agreed by the parties in writing, upon payment in full Microsoft grants Customer a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid-up license to use, reproduce and modify (if applicable) any Microsoft Pre-existing Work provided as part of a Services Deliverable, solely in the form delivered to Customer, and solely for Customer’s internal business purposes. The license to Microsoft’s Pre-Existing Work is conditioned upon Customer’s compliance with the terms of Customer's volume licensing agreement.</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Services Deliverables</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">Any computer code or materials other than Products or Fixes that Microsoft leaves with Customer at the conclusion of Microsoft’s performance of Professional Services are considered Services Deliverables. Upon payment in full for the Professional Services, Microsoft grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license to reproduce, use, and modify the Services Deliverables solely for Customer’s internal business purposes, subject to the terms and conditions governing the Professional Services and Customer’s volume licensing agreement. </p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Use of technical information from Professional Services</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">Microsoft may use any technical information it derives from providing Professional Services for problem resolution, troubleshooting, product functionality enhancements, in Fixes, and for Microsoft’s knowledge base. Microsoft agrees not to identify Customer or disclose any of Customer’s Confidential Information as part of such use. </p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Open Source License Restrictions</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">Customer must not install or use non-Microsoft software or technology in any way that would subject Microsoft’s intellectual property to obligations beyond those included in these Professional Services terms or Customer’s volume licensing agreement.</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Affiliates’ Rights</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">Customer may sublicense the rights to use Services Deliverables to its Affiliates, but Customer’s Affiliates may not sub-license these rights. Customer is liable for ensuring its Affiliates’ compliance with these Professional Services terms and Customer’s volume licensing agreement.</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">Warranties and Limitations of Liability</p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Warranty for Professional Services</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">Microsoft warrants that it will perform the Professional Services with professional care and skill. If Microsoft fails to do so and Customer notifies Microsoft within 90 days of the date the Professional Services were performed, then Microsoft will, as the sole remedy for the breach of the warranty, either re-perform the Professional Services or return the price Customer paid for them.  Except for the limited warranty above, Microsoft provides no other warranties or conditions and disclaims any other express, implied or statutory warranties, including warranties of quality, title, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Limitation of Liability</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">Microsoft’s liability for direct damages will be limited to the amounts Customer was required to pay for the Professional Services. In the case of services provided free of charge, or code Customer is authorized to redistribute to third parties without separate payment to Microsoft, Microsoft’s liability is limited to direct damages up to U.S. $5,000.  In no event will either party be liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages, including loss of use, loss of profits, or interruption of business, however caused or on any theory of liability in relation to the Professional Services. No limitation or exclusions will apply to liability arising out of either party’s (1) confidentiality obligations; or (2) violation of the other party’s intellectual property rights.</p>
