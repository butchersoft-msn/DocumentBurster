If it does not and Customer notifies Microsoft within the warranty term, Microsoft will repair or replace it (at Microsoft’s election) at no charge.

This warranty does not cover problems caused by accident, abuse or use in a manner inconsistent with Customer’s volume license agreement or the product documentation and it is void if the Storage Array is opened or modified, damaged by use with Non-Microsoft Products, or damaged by maintenance or repair performed by anyone other than Microsoft or a Microsoft authorized  vendor.  Microsoft provides no other warranties or conditions and disclaims any other express, implied or statutory warranties, including without limitation, warranties of quality, title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose .</p>
