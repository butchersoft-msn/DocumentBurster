<p class="ProductList-Offering1Heading">Renewing Software Assurance</p>
<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">Renewing Coverage under the Same Agreement</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Terms for renewing SA under the same program agreement by which it was initially ordered are contained Customer's volume licensing agreements. Customers may renew SA without the need to simultaneously order a License as long as the SA coverage has not expired. In addition, the following terms apply to specific programs as noted:</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Open License</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">SA coverage ordered under an Open License authorization number ends upon expiration of that number. To renew, Customer must submit a renewal order for SA within 90 days after their authorization number expiration date.</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Enterprise Agreement</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">To renew SA coverage under the same enrollment under an Enterprise Agreement, Customer must sign a new 2011 or later Enterprise Enrollment and Agreement (if they have not already), and must submit a renewal order for SA (as applicable) for 1) all Enterprise Products, Application Platform Products, Core Infrastructure Products and Additional Products they wish to renew and 2) any Online Services, accounting for transitions (if applicable).</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-SubClauseHeading">Enrollment for Application Platform</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented">EAP customers who have previously deferred  Licenses  via SA prior L SKUs must buyout their  Licenses  before they can renew SA.</p>
<p class="ProductList-BodyIndented"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">Renewing Coverage from a Separate Agreement</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Customer may renew SA for any Product if Customer has obtained a perpetual  License  and SA for that Product under a previous agreement in the same Volume Licensing Program, provided that 1) Customerâ€™s new agreement enrollment, or order (for MPSA) must be effective no later than the day following the date of expiration of the previous agreement or enrollment, and 2) the SA renewal order must be placed prior  to the expiration of prior SA coverage, unless such coverage is being renewed from an Open License Agreement. In that case, Customers have 90 days from the expiration to place the order.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Customer may also renew SA from one Volume Licensing program into a different Volume Licensing Program. For Enterprise Products originally purchased under a program with a company-wide coverage requirement, this exception applies only if the customer is renewing SA into the MPSA or a program with a company-wide coverage requirement for Enterprise Products. For Agreement versions 2008 and prior, as long as coverage is renewed within 30 days (90 days if renewing from Open License program), customers will be deemed to have SA coverage during any period of time between when their expiring SA coverage lapsed and when the new coverage begins.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">Renewing Software Assurance Coverage for Client Access Licenses (CALs) and Client Management Licenses (MLs)</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Transitioning between User and Device CALs :  Customers renewing SA for CALs can switch between User and Device. This transition does not change the CAL edition (i.e. Standard to Enterprise). </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Transitioning between User and OSE Client MLs :  Customers renewing SA for client MLs can switch between User and OSE.</p>
