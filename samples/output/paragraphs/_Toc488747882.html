<p class="ProductList-Offering1Heading">Online Services in the Open Programs</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Under the Open License, Open Value, and Open Value Subscription programs, the subscription period for Online Services starts at the time of product key activation and not the time of order. Once the product key is activated, Microsoft will not accept return requests submitted by Microsoftâ€™s partners.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Customer qualifies for the Open Value program with a minimum purchase of 5 licenses. Online Services User Subscription Licenses (User SLs) can be counted toward the minimum quantity of 5 licenses. However, 5 User SLs alone does not meet the minimum for Open Value Organization Wide and Open Value Subscription. For OV Organization Wide and OV Subscription the initial order must include a minimum of 5 Desktop Platform or Desktop Component Licenses in addition to any User SLs.</p>
