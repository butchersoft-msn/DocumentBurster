<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">Premium Assurance Pricing</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Microsoft will offer four series of Premium Assurance Add-on Licenses. Customer will be eligible to acquire Add-on Licenses within the latest series in effect at the time it first acquires Add-on Licenses for a given Product Family. Customer will be eligible to acquire additional Add-on Licenses within the same series for that Product Family during its current enrollment term and, provided there is no interim lapse in Premium Assurance coverage on its Qualifying Licenses, during any renewal term. Prices within each series are fixed by program and price level, and will not change across renewal terms, other than as necessary to offset exchange rate fluctuations for prices other than U.S. dollars.  </p>
