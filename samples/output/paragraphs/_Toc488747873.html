<p class="ProductList-Offering1Heading">Migration License for Discontinued or End-of-Life Products</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">“ Qualifying License ,” as used here, refers to a  License  with SA coverage as of the date specified and for the Product identified in the product entry referencing this section.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">“ Migration License ,” as used here, refers to rights granted in the Product Entry referencing this section.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Unless stated otherwise in the Product Entry:</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Customer may upgrade to and use software under a Migration License in place of software covered by the Qualifying License. The Customer may not use software under both licenses simultaneously.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Migration Licenses are granted on 1:1 for each of Customer’s Qualifying Licenses.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">If Customer acquired perpetual rights to use software under a Qualifying License, the rights to use software acquired under the Migration License are likewise perpetual; otherwise, rights acquired under a Migration License expire when the underlying Qualifying License expires.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Upon expiration of SA coverage on the Qualifying License, Customer may acquire SA for the same version and edition of the Product covered by the Migration License, without the need to first acquire separate new Licenses. This option does not apply to customers buying licenses under subscription programs (e.g., Enterprise Subscription Agreements or Open Value Subscription agreements).</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Customer may not transfer Migration Licenses separately from Qualifying Licenses.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Subsequently acquired licenses for the same discontinued Product under the same enrollment term under an Enterprise or Enterprise Subscription Agreement, Open Value Subscription or Enrollment for Education Solutions, as part of Customer’s scheduled true-up process are also Qualifying Licenses for purposes of the license grant. Coverage for Products under subscription agreements must be continuous. </p>
