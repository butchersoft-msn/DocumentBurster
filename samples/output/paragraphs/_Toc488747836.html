<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">1. Definitions</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Allocated Annual Commitment  means the portion of the Monetary Commitment allocated annually through the Enrollment term.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Consumption Allowance  is equal to fifty percent of the Allocated Annual Commitment. For example, for an Allocated Annual Commitment of $100,000, the Consumption Allowance for that year would be $50,000.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Consumption Rates  means the prices for Microsoft Azure Services or, for certain Microsoft Azure Service Plans, any usage in excess of a specified quantity. Consumption Rates may also be referred to as “Overage Rates” or “Overage” in other Microsoft or Microsoft Azure documents.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Microsoft Azure Services Plan  means a subscription to one of the individual Microsoft Azure Services identified below as a Microsoft Azure Services Plan. Other than Azure Stack, Services purchased as a Microsoft Azure Services Plan are not eligible for the Hosting Exception in the Online Services Terms.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Monetary Commitment  means the total monetary amount a customer commits to pay over the term of the subscription for its use of eligible Microsoft Azure Services.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">2. Subscription Term</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Customers may only subscribe to Microsoft Azure Services (including Microsoft Azure Services Plans) for a subscription term that ends on the end date of Customer’s Enrollment (“coterminous”). Customers must have at least two months remaining in their Enrollment term in order to subscribe to Microsoft Azure Services.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">3. Purchasing Services</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Microsoft Azure Services may be purchased in one or a combination of the following ways:</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Commitment : Monetary Commitments are allocated proportionally through the Enrollment term. Customers may increase their Monetary Commitment at any time by placing additional orders. When an additional order is placed, Allocated Annual Commitment will be increased for that year by the amount of the order. For each subsequent year remaining in the Enrollment term, Allocated Annual Commitments will be increased by the amount of the additional order, multiplied by twelve, divided by the number of full months between when the additional order was placed and the anniversary date following the additional order. </p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Customers may reduce their Monetary Commitment for any future Enrollment anniversary by notifying their reseller, who must process the reduction with Microsoft prior to the Enrollment anniversary date.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Customers must consume their Allocated Annual Commitment by the last day of the month preceding the Enrollment anniversary each year, after which any unused portion of the Allocated Annual Commitment will be forfeited. Customers may utilize their annual Consumption Allowance by the last day of the month preceding the Enrollment anniversary each year, after which any unused portion of that Consumption Allowance will be forfeited.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Consumption : Customers pay based on the amount of Microsoft Azure Services consumed during a billing period. Certain features of the Microsoft Azure Services may only be available for purchase on a consumption basis.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Microsoft Azure Services Plan : Customers may be able to subscribe to a Microsoft Azure Service as a Microsoft Azure Services Plan. </p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Automatic Provisioning : As part of the Server and Cloud Enrollment, Customers who have not ordered Microsoft Azure Services as part of their Enrollment may receive an activation email from Microsoft inviting them to provision Microsoft Azure Services under their Enrollment without a Monetary Commitment.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">4. Pricing</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Microsoft may offer lower prices to Customer or Customer’s reseller for individual Microsoft Azure Services during a Customer’s Enrollment term on a permanent or temporary (promotional) basis.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-ClauseHeading">5. Payment and Fees</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Customers who have provisioned Microsoft Azure Services without a Monetary Commitment will be invoiced quarterly at Consumption Rates.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">For Customers with a Monetary Commitment the first Allocated Annual Commitment will be invoiced immediately and future Allocated Annual Commitments will be invoiced on the anniversary of the Enrollment effective date. Alternatively, Customers may choose to pay their entire Monetary Commitment upon placing the initial order.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Each month, Microsoft will deduct from the Allocated Annual Commitment the monetary value of Customer’s usage of eligible Microsoft Azure Services. Once Customer’s Allocated Annual Commitment balance has been exhausted, any additional usage will be invoiced at Consumption Rates. </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">If a direct Enterprise Agreement Customer’s usage is lower than the Allocated Annual Commitment plus the Consumption Allowance, any usage exceeding the Allocated Annual Commitment will be invoiced at the Consumption Rates to the Customer or its reseller on the anniversary of the Enrollment effective date for Years 1 and 2 and at the end of the subscription term for Year 3.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">If a direct Enterprise Agreement Customer’s usage is higher than the Allocated Annual Commitment plus the Consumption Allowance, all usage exceeding the Allocated Annual Commitment will be invoiced at Consumption Rates to the Customer or its reseller at the end of each Enrollment quarter.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">For indirect Enterprise Agreement Customers, all usage exceeding the Allocated Annual Commitment will be invoiced at Consumption Rates to the Customer’s reseller at the end of each Enrollment quarter.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">All usage of the Microsoft Azure Services after the expiration or termination of Customer’s subscription term will be invoiced to the customer or its reseller at then-current Consumption Rates on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">The purchase of a Microsoft Azure Services Plan will be invoiced to Customer or its reseller according to the terms of Customer’s volume licensing agreement governing payment terms for the order of Online Services generally. Monetary Commitment cannot be applied to the purchase of a Microsoft Azure Plan; provided, however, that if a Microsoft Azure Services Plan includes the purchase of an initial quantity of a service (“Initial Quantity”), Customer usage that exceeds the Initial Quantity will be billed at Consumption Rates, and Customer’s Allocated Annual Commitment can be applied to such usage.</p>

<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Azure HUB enables Customers’ use of Windows Server on Microsoft Azure through Azure Virtual Machines (“Base Instances”). Azure HUB does not include the cost of Base Instances, and Base instances do not include Windows Server. Each Windows Server processor  License  with SA, and each set of 16 Windows Server core  Licenses  with SA, entitles Customer to use Windows Server on Microsoft Azure on up to 16  Virtual Cores  allocated across two or fewer Azure Base Instances. Each additional set of 8 core  Licenses  with SA entitles use on up to 8  Virtual Cores  and one Base Instance.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Customer must indicate that it is using Windows Server under the Azure HUB when configuring the uploaded image(s) on Azure. Customer may use its uploaded image(s) subject to the  Online Services Terms .</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">The Azure HUB provides additive rights to deploy and use the software when exercised in connection with Datacenter  Licenses  and alternative rights when exercised in connection with Standard  Licenses . Standard  Licenses  are deemed “assigned to Azure” when Customer uses Windows Server under the Azure HUB, and are subject to the  License  reassignment limitations in the  Universal License Terms .</p>
