<p class="ProductList-Offering1Heading">Purchasing Software Assurance</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">There are three different levels of commitment Customer may select when purchasing SA, which may vary by program. Customer can: </p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Commit to attaching SA on all platform products. </p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Commit to attaching SA on all purchases under a particular Product pool (Applications, Systems or Servers), referred to as Software Assurance Membership (SAM). </p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">Purchase SA on individual Products without making any commitment to expanding SA to other Products.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">SA must be acquired at the time of acquiring the  License  or upon renewal of an existing SA term. Unless otherwise stated, only licenses for the latest version of a Product are eligible for SA. In the case of a transfer of perpetual  Licenses , the transferee may acquire SA for such transferred  Licenses  within 30 days from the date of transfer and provided that the transferor maintained active SA for the  Licenses  up until the date of transfer.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">Customers may have the option to acquire SA for certain licenses purchased from the Retail channel (full packaged product) or from an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), within 90 days from the date of purchase as described in the table below. Under Open Value, this option applies only to non-Organizationâ€“wide/ Company-wide products. Under Enterprise Agreements, it applies only to Additional Products. Customers who acquire SA for OEM or retail licenses have the option of installing and using the Volume Licensing software for the current version at any time.</p>
