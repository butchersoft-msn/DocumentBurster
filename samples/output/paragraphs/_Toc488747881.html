<p class="ProductList-Offering1Heading">Definition of Management for Qualified Devices</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">If Customer’s volume licensing agreement refers to the Product Terms, the Product List, or the PUR for defining managed Qualified Devices, the following terms apply. Customer “manages” any device on which it directly or indirectly controls one or more operating system environments. For example, Customer manages any device: </p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">it allows to join its domain, or</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">it authenticates as a requirement to use applications while on its premises, or</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">it installs agents on (e.g., anti-virus, antimalware or other agents mandated by the Customer’s policy), or</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">to which it directly or indirectly applies and enforces group policies, or</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">on which it solicits or receives data about, and, configures, or gives instructions to hardware or software that is directly or indirectly associated with an operating system environment, or</p>
<p class="ProductList-Bullet">it allows to access a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) outside of Windows SA, Microsoft Intune (Device) or Windows Virtual Desktop Access Roaming Rights.</p>
<p class="ProductList-Body"> </p>
<p class="ProductList-Body">A device that accesses a VDI under Roaming Rights only or utilizes Windows To Go on a Qualifying Third Party Device off the Customer’s premises only, and is not managed for other purposes as described here, is not considered “managed” for purposes of this definition.</p>
